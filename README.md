# contact-manager

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is for you to demonstrate the ability to architect and code a solution in JAVA or NodeJS.
You will need to submit your solution within 24 hours of receiving it. We are interested in understanding how you set up your code, how you design it, implement it (even if it’s partially implemented)

### Scope

We would like you to architect and implement a contact management application that will allow the following functionality:

- Add contact
- Edit contact
- Remove contact

A contact should contain a least the following fields:

- First name
- Last name
- Email address

### Architecture and Frameworks

You are free to choose how you architect the solution. It could be a command line app, a REST API, a web page or another interface of your choice.
You can also select the framework(s), libraries and dependency management of your choice (if any). The only requirement is the use of JAVA or NodeJS.

### Guidelines

- The solution should persist the contacts in memory and only during the runtime – it does not need to use a more permanent storage
- For the sake of time, you can leave comments in the code indicating TODOs that would need to be implemented in order for the complete solution to work
- Please provide us with a ZIP file or a download link to your solution
